Workflow of Patients in a Clinical Setting
A hospital is a complex organism covering simultaneously multiple interactions and operations, also different actors perform different activities and tasks that require a level of organization. For this reason, the whole situation in the hospital is represented by what call the Workflow of Patients in a Clinical Setting.
The patient's clinical workflow is basically the interaction between participants in hospitals on various tasks performed in the respective services, flows of medical information related to the clinical workflow, which must be presented very carefully taking into account the detailed specification of the institution, any errors occurring in the clinical patient process. The workflow will impact the data recorded in the electronic health record (EHR), and therefore the entire hospital information system (HIS).
The goal is to capture the remaining services exposed through BPMN and explain them through sequential functional analysis, while preserving old results.
